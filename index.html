       <p>I was born in Brooklyn, NY and raised on the southern shore of Long Island so I was blessed to spend my childhood close to the Atlantic Ocean.  The Atlantic is wildly majestic and still a place of wonder to me.  The bay areas where we lived had many salt marsh wetlands at that time.  The local salt marshes had natural estuaries and trails running through them and exploring them was a favorite pastime for me as a child.  I remember the joy of exploring the local salt march wetlands, boating, fishing, clamming and surfing.  I learned to drive a boat before a car! ;)</p>
       <p>My first taste of ‘serious’ exploration came in the summer of 1976 ( the US bicentennial year) when I teamed up with a college friend for a first time hitchhiking trip along the western coast of the US.  Seattle was the first city on the west coast that we visited.  We backpacked south to San Diego, across the desert to Phoenix, then northwards to the incredible Grand Canyon and beyond.  My visit to Mesa Verde National Park, CO at the famed  ’4 corners’  was a memorable highlight of my trip! ;)</p>
       <p>I finally discovered my real love for the Seattle area once I ventured out to explore the Olympic Mountains and Peninsula!  My favorite camping spots are in The HOH River National Park.  The nearby WA State coastline is ruggedly spectacular to me and stirs my childhood passion to be near ocean and wildlife! ;)</p>
